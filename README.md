## Application's UI
Cloud Castle's UI is simple and elegant. The app's UI is built using [jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/). For navigation it implements the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) library for `jetpack compose`.

## Project's Structure
All the packages reside in the app package except `konsist_test` package. 

![App structure](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/resources/app_structure.png)

The `data` and `ui` packages are layer components of `clean architecture`, the other 3 packages are non-layer components:
*  **di**: This package contains a [Hilt Module](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android#hilt-modules) and other classes that are used in the hilt module.
*  **utils**: This package contains differents classes and objects that are used in the app.
*  **worker**: This package contains a [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/guide/background/persistent/getting-started#define_the_work) class.

## Application's Architecture
Cloud Castle implements `MVVM Architecure` the [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#mobile-app-ux) from Android Developers team and `SOLID principles`, it is scalable and easy to test

![App Architecture](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/resources/clean_architecture.png) 

The `data` and `ui` packages that mentioned above are layers of the MVVM architecture:
*  **data**: The data layer of an app contains the business logic. It is responsible for fetching data from the api through the repositories classes.
*  **ui**:  UI layer is responsible for displaying the data on the screen, it contains screens and `viewmodels`.

## CI
This projects uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to create a CI pipeline. With each push or pull request to the `main` branch the github actions run the workflow localed in [./github/workflows](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
The workflow contains various jobs:
*  `lint`: Checks project source files for potential bugs and optimization improvements for correctness, security, performance, usability, accessibility, and internationalization.
*  `konsist`: Konsist is a powerful static code analyzer tailored for Kotlin, focused on ensuring codebase consistency and adherence to coding conventions.
*  `unit-test`: Run unit tests.
*  `instrumentation-test`: Run instrumentation tests.
*  `build-debug-apk`: Build a debug apk.

## API Authentication
The Cloud Castle API endpoints require an authentication token for the user, the login and signup endpoints return a token that expires in 35 minutes. To improve the user experience the app's implements a mechanism 
to prevent the user login every 35 minutes as long as the app didn't close. There are two http interceptors, [`RequestInterceptor`](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bluecoder/cloudcastle/di/RequestInterceptor.kt)
and [`ResponseInterceptor`](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/bluecoder/cloudcastle/di/ResponseInterceptor.kt)

![Http interceptors](https://github.com/BBlueCoder/Cloud-Castle-Android/blob/master/resources/http_interceptors.png)

*  `RequestInterceptor`: Intercepts every http request and add a token to the headers of the request.
*  `ResponseInterceptor`: Intercepts every response, if the response code is 401 that means the token is expired, log the user in again and resend the request with the new token.
